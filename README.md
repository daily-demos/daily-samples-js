# Daily JavaScript Samples

This repository holds small sample code showcasing Daily's JavaScript API features, often accompanied by a blog post. These samples will feature our [Client SDK for JavaScript](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js) and our [Daily Prebuilt](https://docs.daily.co/guides/products/prebuilt) embed, which are both instrumented through the [`daily-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@daily-co/daily-js) client-side library.
