# Daily JavaScript Samples

This repository holds small sample code written by Daily devs to showcase specific features of Daily's JavaScript API. These samples will feature our [Client SDK for JavaScript](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js) and our [Daily Prebuilt](https://docs.daily.co/guides/products/prebuilt) embed, which are both instrumented through the [`daily-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@daily-co/daily-js) client-side library.

The samples within this repo will utilize vanilla JS or TypeScript. Framework demos showing use of Daily with React, Vue, Next.js, and more can be found in their own repositories within the `daily-demos` org.

## Bug reports and contributions

Bug reports and feature requests are always welcome and can be [submitted as a GitHub issue](https://github.com/daily-demos/daily-samples-js/issues) in this repository.

Samples are primarily written by Daily devs, but pull requests with fixes or improvements are encouraged.
