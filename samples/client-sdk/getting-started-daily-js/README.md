# Getting started with daily-js

This is a basic daily-js demo showing how to build a simple calling app using JavaScript.

This demo shows how to:

- Create a call object
- Join a room
- Attach video and audio tracks to the DOM
- Control your camera and microphone devices
- Select a new camera or microphone device
- Leave a call and clean up

## Prerequisites

You will need a Daily account to test out this call. You can sign up at https://dashboard.daily.co/signup.

## Running the demo locally

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:daily-demos/daily-samples-js.git
cd daily-samples-js/samples/client-sdk/getting-started-daily-js
./run_server.sh
```

This script will open a new browser page, which you can use to start a call.
